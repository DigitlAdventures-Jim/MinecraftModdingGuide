<h1>Replace Block Texture</h1>
<p>This is a guide that will help students replace DigiMod items textures with their own designs
which is the quickest way to have their creations come to life in minecraft.</p>


<h2>Replace Block Texture File</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Name the file to correctly match the name of the file in the DigiMod you wish to replace.</li>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/textures/blocks.</li>
  <li>Drag your block texture into the blocks folder either on top of any of the files in the folder, or
    on the actual folder.
  </li>
  <li>It will prompt you to copy or link the file into the folder, you will almost always want to copy.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to overwrite the old image, we will want to do this as well.</li>
</ol>
