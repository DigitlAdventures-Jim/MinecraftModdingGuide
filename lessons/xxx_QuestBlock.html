<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are going to design a mod today that created a block where when a living
   entity steps on it, it will create a cage around it as well as apply a harmful effect.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>In programming we may want to access a class that is lower in the object tree.
In today's project we will need to downcast from the very top level class of Entity (which includes arrows,
 fireballs and other non-living things) to the more specific class EntityLivingBase. EntityLivingBase is built from the Entity class and includes the living things in
  minecraft that we will be able to add potion effects to.</p>


<h2>Create Block Texture</h2>
<p>Use the create Create Block Texture guide to create a new block texture.</p>

<h2>Create a block</h2>
<p>Use the Block Creation guide add a new custom block to minecraft.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_block.html">Create Block</a>

<h2>Rename the Block</h2>
<p>Use the Naming Items and Blocks guide to change the name of the digi_block within the en_us.lang file.</p>
<p>Feel free to use special color codes for more unique names here.</p>

<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create QuestBlock Class</h2>
<p>Within the /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/init/DigiBlocks.java file
we will want to change the class of our custom block from BlockBase to QuestBlock</p>
<pre>public static final BlockBase QUEST_BLOCK = new QuestBlock("quest_block"); </pre>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the lightbulb on the left of this line of code to create a new class called QuestBlock.</li>
  <li>In the package name you will want to type in "com.digitaladventures.digimod.blocks".</li>
  <li>This should open a new class, we will want to make sure this Block extends BlockBase.</li>
  <li>BlockBase sets up the block so it is registered into our mod.</li>
  <li>Hover over the error icon on the left and add in the required constructor.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Set up</h2>
<p>In minecraft each block is a clone of a </p>

<h2>CODE </h2>
<pre>

    int questCount = 10;
  	ItemStack questItem = new ItemStack(Items.APPLE);
  	Item reward = Items.DIAMOND;

      public boolean onBlockActivated(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, EntityPlayer playerIn, EnumHand hand, EnumFacing facing, float hitX, float hitY, float hitZ)
      {

      	if(!worldIn.isRemote) {
  	    	if (playerIn.inventory.hasItemStack(questItem)) {
  	    		int slot = playerIn.inventory.getSlotFor(questItem);
  	    		playerIn.inventory.decrStackSize(slot, 1);
  	    		questCount-=1;
  	    		playerIn.sendMessage(new TextComponentString("Thank you"));

  	    		if (questCount<1) {
  	    			playerIn.dropItem(reward, 1);
  	    			playerIn.sendMessage(new TextComponentString("Quest Completed"));
  	    			questCount=10;
  	    			worldIn.destroyBlock(pos, false);
  	    		}
  	    	}else{
  	    		playerIn.sendMessage(new TextComponentString("Bring "+ Integer.toString(questCount) +" "+ questItem.getDisplayName()+"(s) for a reward!"));

  	    	}
      	}
          return true;
      }

</pre>


<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has
    been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
  <li>You can switch to survival mode by typing "/gamemode s" while in the game.</li>
  <li>Try right clicking on the block with the quest item and without.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intermediate: Extend Trap container</h2>
<p>Try to create a trap that has a large interior for larger amounts of enemies to trap.</p>

<h2>Advanced: Create Block Recipe</h2>
<p>Try to create a recipe inside of the recipes.json file inside of resources. You can try using the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_recipe.html">Create Recipe guide.</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to src/main/resources/assets.dm.recipes.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste either a shaped or shapeless recipe.</li>
  <li>Adjust the name of the file and it's contents to match your recipe idea.</li>

</ol>
