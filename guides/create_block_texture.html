<h1>Create Block Texture</h1>


<h2>Go To Piskel App</h2>
<p>
Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.piskelapp.com/create" target="_blank">www.piskelapp.com/create</a>. Piskel app
will allow us to create png images which are needed for minecraft textures. png files have transparent
backgrounds which are necesarry for designing in games so that we don't have big white background boxes
thoughout.
</p>


<h2>Resize Image</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the resize button on the right side of the screen</li>
  <li>Change the size to 16x16 to match minecrafts pixel size</li>
  <li>Click the yellow resize button</li>
</ol>


<h2>Design Image</h2>
<p>
A standard block should have the entire design filled in. If you are looking to create custom
block models then you can leave out some space, but you'll need to write a few Java functions, or adjust
the model json file to ensure that the rendering of the box is correct.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hover over the toolbar on the left to read what each tool does.</li>
  <li>You will mostly just need the pen and eraser tools</li>
  <li>For a smaller or larger pen you can click the boxes above the toolbar</li>

  adjust both the hue (rainbow slider on the right) the saturation and
  brightness(the big box on the left) </li>
