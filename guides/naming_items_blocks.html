<h1>Naming Items and Blocks</h1>

<p>Naming items, blocks and creative tabs can be done to change the appearance of the name input
the game of minecraft. It will not change how we reference the name in our coding environment.</p>

<h2>Editing the Language File</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Locate the Language file by navigating to and opening MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/en_us.lang</li>
  <li>Find the name of the item you are replacing. If you are replacing a Sword, find  <pre>item.digi_sword.name</pre></li>
  <li>Replace everything after the = sign with what you would like to have displayed in the game</li>
</ol>


<h2>Creating a new item or block name</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to and open MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/lang/en_us.lang</li>
  <li>Add in a new line of code at the bottom</li>
  <li>type "item.my_item.name= My New Item" for an item</li>
  <li>type "tile.my_block.name= My New Block" for a block</li>

  <li>Everything after the = sign in this line of code will show up as the name of this item in minecraft</li>
  <li>This is only the display name, we will still use my_item as name we refer to the item as in our code</li>
  <pre>
  item.my_item.name= My New Item
  tile.my_block.name= My New Block
  </pre>
</ol>

<h2>Advanced Naming options</h2>
<p>You can use minecraft formatting codes for more advanced naming options!</p>
