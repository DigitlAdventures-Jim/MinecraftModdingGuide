</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To make custom blocks in minecraft we are going to be adding in our own block designs into
the minecraft modding workspace with eclipse. We are going to be adding onto the Digi Mod which already
has a bunch of basic mods that we can change and add code to.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>Have students think of any object in the world. Then try to write down the properties these items have. For example...</p>
<ul>
  <p><u>Lamp</u></p>
  <li>Emits light</li>
  <li>Cloth top</li>
  <li>Glass base</li>
  <li>Not smelly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create Block Texture</h2>
<p>Use the create Create Block Texture guide to create a new block texture.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="./guides/create_block_texture.html">Create Block Texture</a>

<h2>Replace Block Texture</h2>
<p>Use the replace block texture guide to replace the texture of the digi_block.png</p>
<a target="_blank" href="guides/replace_block_texture.html">Replace Block Texture</a>

<h2>Rename the Block</h2>
<p>Use the Naming Items and Blocks guide to change the name of the digi_block within the en_us.lang file.</p>
<p>Feel free to use special color codes for more unique names here.</p>

<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
</ul>

<h2> DigiBlock Class</h2>

<p>The class is a file that holds all of the information for how our Block should act.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate to the Java folder to find and open java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/blocks/DigiBlock.java</li>
  <li>This DigiBlock class is extending another class or file called BlockBase which has all the code needed for building a basic block.</li>
  <li>Extending is much better than recoding our entire block because we can use code already created by minecraft programmers.</li>
  <li>The super() method tells this block to use the same constructor as the Base Block. It requires the name, and  block material.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Change Block Properties</h2>
<p>Next we are going to be adjusting the properties of our block. We are going to do this by running some methods
inside of the constructor of our Blocks class</p>
<p>A method is a task an object will do when we type it in. A constructor is a section of code that will run once at the creation
of a class (it has the same name of the class in Java).</p>
<p>The methods inside our constructor have green slashes next to them. This means that they are "commented out". Commenting with two
slashes means that the words after are to be ignored by the program and minecraft. This is how you can write notes in your code. This is also
a great way to disable or enable code quickly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  <code>setSoundType(SoundType.METAL);</code>   This method requires a SoundType, you can see the SoundType options by deleting ".METAL" and thentyping in "." </li>
  <li><code>setHardness(5.0F);</code> This method is how hard the block is to break with your player, This requires a number which ends with F for Float. Floats are decimal point numbers.</li>
  <li><code>setResistance(15.0F);</code> This sets how resistant your block is to explosions.</li>
  <li><code>setHarvestLevel("pickaxe", 2);</code> This sets the level of pickaxe needed to get the item from this block.</li>
  <li><code>setLightLevel(1.0F);</code> This sets the light emission of your block, 1.0F is the highest 0.0F is the lowest.</li>
  <li><code>setLightOpacity(1);</code> This sets how much light the block will block.</li>
  <li><code>setBlockUnbreakable();</code> This method requires no parameters, it simply sets the block unbreakable (unless you are in creative mode)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
  <li>You can switch to survival mode by typing "/gamemode s" while in the game.</li>
  <li>Try breaking it in survival with a pickaxe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced: Create Block Recipe</h2>
<p>Try to create a recipe inside of the recipes.json file inside of resources. You can try using the <a target="_blank" href="create_recipe.html">Create Recipe guide.</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to src/main/resources/assets.dm.recipes.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste either a shaped or shapeless recipe.</li>
  <li>Adjust the name of the file and it's contents to match your recipe idea.</li>

</ol>
