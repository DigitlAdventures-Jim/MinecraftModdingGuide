<h1>Working With Eclipse</h1>

<h2>Loading A Workspace</h2>
<p>open eclipse and then click on "browse". If eclipse opens a workspace automatically you
can click "File>Switch Workspace"</p>
<p>Choose a Minecraft modding workspace and make sure to select the eclipse folder within
the minecraft modding worspace folder.</p>
<p>The path should look like this..."Dekstop/StudentMods/Jims_MinecraftMod/eclipse" </p>

<h2>Playing The Game</h2>
<p>To play the modded version of minecraft you need to click on the run button (ONCE) which looks like a circle with a green arrow
pointed to the right at the top. </p>
<p>You will be unable to play multiplayer games since there will almost certainly be a mod version mismatch with any other player.</p>
<p>You can play single player, creative mode, so that it is easier to access DigiMod items.</p>
<p>To exit you can exit minecraft normally, or click on the red stop button (very helpful for students who smash the run button) at the top right of the Console.</p>
<p>When in game your player will randomly be chosen as Steve or Alex, you will also recieve a temporary name like "Player 223".</p>

<h2>Easier Navigation</h2>
<h3>If this is the first time the workspace is open you may want to re-organize the
Package Explorer on the left.</h3>
<p>Click on the small down arrow menu at the top right of the Package Explorer window.Select the "Package Presentation" option and click "Hierarchical".</p>

<h3>Sometimes we may want to work with these folders and packages in the finder instead of Eclipse
so it is easier to manage files.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Right click on the folder</li>
  <li>highlight "show in"</li>
  <li>Select "System Explorer"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Resetting User Interface</h3>
<p>It is possible to remove windows, tabs or options that may make it more difficult to work in Eclipse.
At the top of the screen select Window>Reset Perspective to reset the interface. This is very handy for
fixing students workspaces quickly.</p>
