<p>To check your java version you can open the terminal app and then type "java -update"</p>
<p>It should read ...

<h2>Create Additional Workspaces (automatic creation)</h2>
<p>Download the application to create student workspaces <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9q0hu7q15xgcq57/CreateStudentWorkspace.zip?dl=0">here</a>. You'll only need one per work station.</p>
<p>Use the CreateStudentWorkspace app by dragging this application to the folder you want to create
additional workspaces, ideally inside of a Minecraft_Mods folder on the dekstop</p>
<p>Double click on the app, type in the workspace name "StudentName_MinecraftMod", You can also create
workspaces for more general purposes like a mod for a week of camp, or a birthday party.</p>


<h2>Create Additional Workspace (manual creation)</h2>
<p>If Automatic Creation does not work you may need to manually create a modding workspace by unzipping a forge-1.12.2 zipped folder
from inside a student workspace folder.</p>
<p>Rename the folder before any other actions, otherwise the workspace will fail.</p>
<p>In terminal, type "cd" then drag in the folder to the terminal window.</p>
<p>Now that we are within the workspace folder you can run the command "./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace".</p>
<p>After this command completes successfully you can run "./gradlew eclipse".</p>
<p>Lastly you will need to replace the src folder within this workspace with a DigiMod src folder.</p>
