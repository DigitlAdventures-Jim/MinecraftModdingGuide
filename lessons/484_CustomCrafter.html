<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project we will be creating our own crafting recipes using JSON files. JSON files are used often with
  programming to send data in an organized way.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>

<p>Students should draw a 3/3 grid (similar to tic tac toe), and then write ingredients into them to create a new recipe for minecraft.</p>


<h2>Create a Shaped Recipe</h2>
<p>Using the <a  target="_blank"  href="../guides/create_recipe.html">Create recipe guide</a> walk through the creation of a custom shaped recipe. </p>
<p>You can use this json code below as an example of how to turn dirt into diamonds.</p>
<p>The "data": key is needed for many blocks or items which use meta data like wool or dyes. Using 32767 for the data value will let you
use any type of wool or dye.</p>

  {
      "type": "minecraft:crafting_shaped",
      "pattern": [
          "DDD",
          "DDD",
          "DDD"
      ],
      "key": {
          "#": {
              "item": "minecraft:dirt",
              "data":0
          }
      },
      "result": {
          "item": "minecraft:diamond",
          "count": 1
      }
  }

<h2>Intermediate Smelting!</h2>
<p>Smelting in 1.12 is completed using Java code within a recipes class in our workspace.
You can use the  <a target="_blank"  href="../guides/create_smelting_recipe.html">Create Smelting Recipe Guide</a> to have students create custom furnace recipes.</p>
