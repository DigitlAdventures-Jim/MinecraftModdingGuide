<h1>Create Block</h1>

<h2>Block Textures</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/textures/blocks.</li>
  <li>Drag your block texture into the blocks folder either on top of any of the files in the folder, or
    on the actual folder.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Block Item Model</h2>
<p>The item texture for a block is what the block looks like while being held.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/models/item.</li>
  <li>to make adding a model file more quickly select the digi_block.json file, press cmd+c and then cmd+v to copy and paste it.</li>
  <li>The digi_block.json file is the most basic item model file for blocks.</li>
  <li>Rename the file to match your new block, only use lowercase letters and underscores instead of
  spaces. This guide uses my_block but you should use your own unique item name</li>
  <li>double click into this new my_item.json file and change the texture location to match your new block.
    This code simply points to the block model as the one it should use for when the block is being held like an item.</li>

  <pre>{
    {
       "parent": "dm:block/my_block"
    }
  </pre>

</ol>

<h2>Block Block Model</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/models/block.</li>
  <li>To make adding a model file faster select the digi_block.json file, press cmd+c and then cmd+v to copy and paste it.</li>
  <li>The digi_block.json file is the most basic block model file for blocks.</li>
  <li>Rename the file to match your new block, only use lowercase letters and underscores instead of
  spaces.</li>
  <li>double click into this new my_block.json file and change the texture location to match your new block.</li>
  <li>block/cube_all is the key to this script as it makes the texture for our block the same on all sides.</li>
  <pre>{
    {
       "parent": "block/cube_all",
       "textures": {
           "all": "dm:blocks/digi_block"
       }
    }
  </pre>

</ol>

<h2>Add a BlockState file</h2>
<p>Block states are ways a block can look differently in different situations in minecraft. Doors open or closed,
levers up or down, fences facing north, south, east or west.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/lang/en_us.lang</li>
  <li>Copy and past the digi_block.json file, or create a new .json file with the code below.</li>
  <li>this json markup code is to just display the block without any varients.</li>
  <pre> {
    "variants": {
        "normal": { "model": "dm:my_block" }
    }
  }
  </pre>
</ol>

<h2>Block Lang</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/lang/en_us.lang</li>
  <li>Add in a new line of code at the bottom</li>
  <li>type "Item.my_item.name= My New Item"</li>
  <li>Everything after the = sign in this line of code will show up as the name of this item in minecraft</li>
  <li>This is only the display name, we will still use my_item as name we refer to the item as in our code</li>
  <pre>
  tile.my_block.name=My New Block
  </pre>
</ol>

<h2>Initialize</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/init/DigiBlocks.java</li>
  <li>Scroll to where it says "//New Blocks"</li>
  <li>Add this new line of Java Code "public static final BlockBase MY_BLOCK = new BlockBase("my_block");"</li>
  <li>In this code we are creating a new BlockBase called MY_BLOCK which is an extension of the standard minecraft Block</li>
  <li>BlockBase holds all of the information for adding this block into minecraft and connecting
  the texture and model files to this item.</li>
  <li>Public static final are keywords which describe how this new instance or clone of the BaseBlock can be
  interacted with.</li>
</ol>
