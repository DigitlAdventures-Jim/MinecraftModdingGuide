<h2>Create Smelting Recipe</h2>

<p>Furnace recipes are simple enough that we don't need to create them in a JSON file.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to and open /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/init/ModRecipes.java</li>
  <li>Read the smelting recipes already created in the game.</li>
  <li>The addSmelting() method has 4 parts. The Item you create, the Item we use as the ingredient, the total items and the experience gained.</li>
  <li>The Item we recieve and the amount are consolidated into an ItemStack object (a stack of a certain item).</li>

<ul>
  <li>Input: (Item or Block) The block or item that we place into the furnace. </li>
  <li>Result: (ItemStack) An object that contains a new instance of an item or block as well as the total(int).</li>
  <li>Experience: (Float) </li>
</ul>

  <li>Create your own line of code right beneath these smelting recipes and customize the
  options/argument.</li>
</ol>
