<h2>Armor Layers</h2>
<p>In Minecraft there are two layers to armor. One layer is stuck to the player while the other layer expands the
players model. Layer_1 normally has the chestplate, helmet and boots. Layer_2 usually has just the leggins and mid section.
You don't need to use both layers but for best results you can follow with minecrafts standard.</p>


<h2>Design Armor</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose either layer 1 or layer 2 for any of the armor types.</li>
<li>Press the select option at the top to isolate which part you'd like to work on.</li>
<li>You can change the color of the pencil at the bottom.</li>
<li>The image editor at the top allows you to view the texture unwrapped and flat.</li>
<li>When you finish press the save button on the top, then select the download tab, right click the picture and save as a new png file.</li>
<li>Rename the file myarmor_layer_1.png or myarmor_layer_2.png</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create Armor Items</h2>
<p>Although the armor when worn will look like the armor you designed, the icons and items that represent them will not because they are not associated with the
images we just created. Armor when not worn act like items .You will need to create a 16x16 design for the helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots.
that closely resemble your armor designs. You can use the link below for help with replacing armor icon textures since they work just like items.</p>
