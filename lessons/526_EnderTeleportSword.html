<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this mod we will be creating a sword that can teleport nearby, similar to how an enderman is allowed to teleport.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>In this project we will need to program using a rayTrace, a ray trace is a way to create a
   line or path from one position in 3d to another, usually referring to light.
   As an activity we will close our eyes and then point in a random direction. Then we will need to trace the path from our
   finger to the object we are pointing to or that is in the way of our pointing path.
</p>


<h2>Create custom sword tool</h2>
<p>Use the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_item_texture.html">Create Item Texture </a> to create a new sword design.</p>
<p>Use the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_item.html">Create Item Guide</a> to create a new Sword in minecraft</p>

<h2>Create Custom Class</h2>
  <p>After we create the Initialize code we will want to change the class of the Sword.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your Initialize code should read...</li>
    <pre>public static final ItemSword ENDER_SWORD = new ItemEnderSword("ender_sword", MATERIAL_DIGI);</pre>
    <li>Click the error lightbulb on the left of this line of code to create a new class automatically. </li>
    <li>In the popup window you will want to change the package name to com.digitaladventures.digimod.item then press finish.</li>
    <li>This should open up a new file with our custom ItemEnderSword class.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Custom EnderSword Code</h2>
<p>Our goal will be to teleport our character when we click the left and right click simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our code will include an event that will detect right clicks with our custom item, an if statement that checks to see if the player
is swinging the item and then create a raytrace that gives us the position of the block we are looking at. Finally we teleport there and then reduce fall distance
so we do not get falling damage when teleporting.</p>

<h2>CODE</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You can copy and paste the onItemRightClick event from the digimod.items.base.ItemBase.java file or type it in.</li>
  <li>Next create the if statement that checks if the player who is right clicking is swinging their item.</li>
  <li>Inside that if statement you can create a BlockPos pos object to hold the position of the players raytrace. RayTrace() takes 2 parametes,
  the maxiumum distance and the position of your players eyes which is 1 block high.</li>
  <li>Next we will set your players position to that position that we just saved into BlockPos pos. We add 1 to the Y position so we are above the block we are teleporting to.</li>
  <li>Then we can set you player.fallDistance to = 0f;</li>
</ol>

<pre>
  public ActionResult<ItemStack> onItemRightClick(World worldIn, EntityPlayer player, EnumHand hand)
  {
  if(player.isSwingInProgress) {
    BlockPos pos =  player.rayTrace(100, 1.0F).getBlockPos();
    player.setPosition(pos.getX(), pos.getY()+1, pos.getZ());
    player.fallDistance=0f;
  }
    return new ActionResult<ItemStack>(EnumActionResult.PASS, player.getHeldItem(hand));
  }
</pre>

<h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>Add partical effects and sounds each time you teleport!</p>
<pre>
player.playSound(SoundEvents.ENTITY_LIGHTNING_THUNDER, 1f, 1f); //Sound of lightning
worldIn.spawnParticle(EnumParticleTypes.CRIT_MAGIC, player.posX+1, player.posY, player.posZ, 0f, 0f, 0f); //left particle
worldIn.spawnParticle(EnumParticleTypes.CRIT_MAGIC, player.posX, player.posY+2, player.posZ, 0f, 0f, 0f); //above particle
worldIn.spawnParticle(EnumParticleTypes.CRIT_MAGIC, player.posX-1, player.posY, player.posZ, 0f, 0f, 0f); //right particle
</pre>
