<div id="public">
<h4><a  name="public">public (keyword)</a></h4>
<p>public is a Java keyword which declares a member's access as public.
  Public members are visible to all other classes.
  This means that any other class can access a public field or method.
  Further, other classes can modify public fields unless the field is declared as final .</p>
</div>

<div id="static">
<h4><a  name="static">static (keyword)</a></h4>
<p>A Java keyword used to define a variable as a class variable.
  Classes maintain one copy of class variables regardless of how many instances
  exist of that class. static can also be used to define a method as a class method.
   Class methods are invoked by the class instead of a specific instance, and
   can only operate on class variables. </p>
</div>


<div id="final">
<h4><a  name="final">final (keyword)</a></h4>
<p>A Java keyword. You define an entity once and cannot change it or derive from it later.
  More specifically: a final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden
  and a final variable cannot change from its initialized value.</p>
</div>

<div id="blockbase">
<h4><a  name="blockbase">BlockBase (class)</a></h4>
<p>A class that can be extended that will speed up the creation of

</div>

<div id="itembase">
<h4><a name="itembase">ItemBase (class)</a></h4>
<p>A class that can be extended that will speed up the creation of

<div id="toolbaseclasses">
<h4><a name="toolbaseclasses">Tool Base Classes (class)</a></h4>
<p>A class that can be extended that will speed up the creation of
a custom tool. The ToolAxe, ToolSword, ToolPickaxe, ToolHoe and ToolSpade classes extends minecrafts tool
classes which give the tools their ability (mining, digging, chopping) and extends the Item class.</p>
</div>

<div id="float">
<h4><a name="float">Float (data type)</a></h4>
<p>The float data type can store fractional numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038. Note that you
  should end the value with an "f". Examples-> 4.5f, -23.4f, 2f </p></div>

<div id="int">
<h4><a name="int">Int (data type)</a></h4>
<p>The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
  In general, the int data type is the preferred data
  type when we create variables with a numeric value. Examples-> 1, 4, -2, 0</p></div>

<div id="double">
<h4><a name="double">Double (data type)</a></h4>
<p>The double data type can store fractional numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+308.
  This is just like a float, except it has 15 digits of precision.
  Note that you should end the value with a "d". Examples-> 2.3d, 348.29d, 1d</p></div>

<div id="boolean">
<h4><a name="boolean">Boolean (data type)</a></h4>
<p>A boolean data type is declared with the boolean keyword and
  can only take the values true or false:</p></div>

<div id="int">
<h4><a name="int">Int (data type)</a></h4>
<p>The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
In general, the int data type is the preferred data
type when we create variables with a numeric value. Examples-> 1, 4, -2, 0</p></div>

<div id="string">
<h4><a name="string">String (data type)</a></h4>
<p>A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:
  Examples-> "hello", "o8adhfa7", "9" </p></div>

<div id="array">
<h4><a name="array">Array (data type)</a></h4>
<p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
  Examples-> int[]={3,4,5,3};, string[]={"hello","ok","monkey"}; </p></div>
