<h1>Replace Plant Texture</h1>
<p>This is a guide that will help students replace digiplant items textures with their own designs
which is the quickest way to have their creations come to life in minecraft.</p>


<h2>Replace Plant Texture Files</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Name the image files to match digi_plant0-7.</li>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/textures/blocks.</li>
  <li>Drag your block textures into the blocks folder either on top of any of the files in the folder, or
    on the actual folder.
  </li>
  <li>It will prompt you to copy or link the file into the folder, you will almost always want to copy.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to overwrite the old image, we will want to do this as well.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adjusting Plant Models</h2>
<p>If you would like to adjust the order of the plants, or you would like to use the same texture for multiple stages
 you will want to change the model json files for the digi_plants</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/models/block.</li>
  <li>digiplant.json (with no number at the end) is what the plant looks like while in your hand.</li>
  <pre>{ 
   "parent": "block/crop",   
   "textures": { 
       "crop": "dm:blocks/digi_plant0" 
   } 
}</pre>
  <li>You will need to replace the text after the "dm:blocks/" to match what texture name you want to use for the look of the plant
  when it is being held. </li>
  <li>You can do this for all 8 other digi_plant#.json files. digi_plant0.json is the youngest plant, and digi_plant8.json is the oldest the plant will appear.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Replace Seed Texture File</h2>
<p>Seed textures are just like any other item texture.</p>
