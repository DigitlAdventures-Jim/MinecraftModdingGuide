<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project we will be creating our own custom plant by replacing and adjusting the digi_plant.
This will involve the changing of up to 7 plant model textures, a seed item and optionally a dropped item.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>

<p>Create a very simple animation in piskel app to make it looke like a ball or dot is moving.
Show students how to use the onion skin option so that they can view previous frames.</p>

<h2>Create 7 Plant Model Textures and Seed</h2>
<p>Using Piskel app and the .zip file export, export an animation of your plant growing, starting
with a very tiny plant to one that fills up the animation frame.</p>
<p>You can use the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_plant_texture.html">Create Plant Texture Guide</a> for steps
  on designing the model textures and seed texture.</p>

<h2>Replace Plant and Seed Textures</h2>
<p>You can use the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/replace_plant_texture.html">Replace Plant Texture Guide</a>
for steps on replacing the plant and seeds as well as working with the plant model files and blockstates if necesarry.</p>
<p>This would be a good time to test your mod.</p>

<h2>Changing Plant Drops</h2>
<p>In minecraft once a plant grows to the last stage you can collect the drop.
a quick way to grow a plant is by right clicking it with bonemeal.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to and open /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/blocks/DigiPlant.java</li>
  <li>Since a plant is a block, you can adjust or add to some of it's properties like hardess and light opacity.</li>
  <li>Make changes to the code below so that the return is the item you wish your plant to drop.</li>
  <pre>
    @Override
	     protected Item getCrop() {
		        return DigiItems.DIGI_FOOD;
	    }
	</pre>
</ol>

<h2>Advanced: Create new drop Item</h2>
<p>Use the <a target="_blank "href="../guides/create_item.html">Create Item Guide</a> to design
a new item that your plant should drop.</p>
