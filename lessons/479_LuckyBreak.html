<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are going to be creating a mod where your player can get lucky! We will be
creating a custom event where when we break any block in the game a lucky thing may occur
at random.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>

<p>Write down a number between 1 and 100. Have each students win a 3d print or small prize if they can guess it within three tries.</p>




<h2>Find DigiEvents</h2>
<ol>

<li>Navigate to src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/DigiEvents.java</li>

<li>Start by subscribing a new event within this class file. When we subscribe to an event it
  allows this code to listen for and trigger once the event associated with it occurs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create LuckyBreak Event</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Next create our new listening event called LuckyBreak, which will be passing through the BreakEvent
  that we can give an instance/temporary name of event</li>
  <li>event will now hold information each time we break a block. including the position and the player who
  broke the block.</li>

  <pre>
    @SubscribeEvent
    public void LuckyBreak( BreakEvent event){

    }
  </pre>

<li>Next we want to create a random number. We can do this by creating a random
  number generator object and calling it rand.</li>
<li>Create a variable and set it to a random number between 0 and 100 by
  using rand.nextInt(101). 101 can be changed to any integer.</li>
<li>Then we will use if statement to check what number it is. If the number is
  very high, we will get a prize dorpped to our player.</li>
<li>event.getPlayer() will grab the player who broke the block, and dropItem drops
  the item next to them. "Items" is a class you can use to grab minecraft items.
  If you want to drop a modded Item you could use DigiItems. If you want to use a Block you'll need to use
  "Items.getItemFromBlock(Blocks.NAMEOFBLOCK)" or "Items.getItemFromBlock(DigiBlocks.NAMEOFBLOCK)".</li>
<pre>
  if(effect_number>99) {
    event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.DIAMOND,1);
  }
</pre>

<h2>Intermediate</h2>
<p>Try to create an if statement with a larger range and a less desirable award.</p>
<pre>
  if(effect_number>90 && effect_number<99) {
    event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.APPLE,1);
  }
</pre>

<h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>Create if statements so that certain effects only apply to certain blocks using event.getState().getBlock().</p>
<pre>
  if(effect_number>90 && effect_number<99) {
      if(event.getState().getBlock() == Blocks.DIRT) {
    event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.APPLE,1);
      }else {
      event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.POTATO,1);
      }
  }
</pre>


<h2>Completed Code</h2>
<pre>
  @SubscribeEvent
     public void LuckyBreak( BreakEvent event){
     	Random rand = new Random();
     	int effect_number = rand.nextInt(101);

     	if(effect_number>99) {
     		event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.DIAMOND,1);
     	}
     	if(effect_number<2) {
     		event.getPlayer().addPotionEffect(new PotionEffect(MobEffects.POISON,100,4));
     	}
     	if(effect_number>90 && effect_number<99) {
         	if(event.getState().getBlock() == Blocks.DIRT) {
     		event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.APPLE,1);
         	}else {
         	event.getPlayer().dropItem(Items.POTATO,1);
         	}
     	}

     }
</pre>
