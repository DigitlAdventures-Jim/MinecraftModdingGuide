<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are going to design a mod today that created a block where when a living
   entity steps on it, it will create a cage around it as well as apply a harmful effect.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>In programming we may want to access a class that is lower in the object tree.
In today's project we will need to downcast from the very top level class of Entity (which includes arrows,
 fireballs and other non-living things) to the more specific class EntityLivingBase. EntityLivingBase is built from the Entity class and includes the living things in
  minecraft that we will be able to add potion effects to.</p>


<h2>Create Block Texture</h2>
<p>Use the create Create Block Texture guide to create a new block texture.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_block_texture.html">Create Block Texture</a>

<h2>Create a block</h2>
<p>Use the Block Creation guide add a new custom block to minecraft.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_block.html">Create Block</a>

<h2>Rename the Block</h2>
<p>Use the Naming Items and Blocks guide to change the name of within the en_us.lang file.</p>
<p>Feel free to use special color codes for more unique names here.</p>

<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create TunnelBlock Class</h2>
<p>Within the /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/init/DigiBlocks.java file
we will want to change the class of our custom block from BlockBase to TunnelBlock</p>
<pre>public static final BlockBase TUNNEL_BLOCK = new TunnelBlock("tunnel_block"); </pre>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the lightbulb on the left of this line of code to create a new class called TunnelBlock.</li>
  <li>In the package name you will want to type in "com.digitaladventures.digimod.blocks".</li>
  <li>This should open a new class/file, we will want to make sure this TunnelBlock extends BlockBase.</li>
  <li>BlockBase sets up the block so it is registered into our mod.</li>
  <li>Hover over the error on the left and add in the required constructor which passes through basic block properties.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Block Activation</h2>
<p>Minecraft blocks can be activated using a right click, we can use the method onBlockActivated to activate code when we
right click a block.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We will first need to write the method and have it return a boolean of true.</li>
  <pre>  public boolean onBlockActivated(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, EntityPlayer playerIn, EnumHand hand, EnumFacing facing, float hitX, float hitY, float hitZ)
    {
        return true;
    }</pre>
  <li>If we return false, the block will activate twice (one for each hand) instead of just once total. </li>
  <li>Next we will schedule an update on the current position and current block to occur in 10 game ticks. (30 ticks per second)</li>
  <li>Blocks don't update on their own, so we have to schedule them ourselves.</li>
  <pre>
    worldIn.scheduleUpdate(pos, state.getBlock(), 10);
  </pre>
</ol>

<p>We will next need to create a method which will activate once the scheduled update occurs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with the updateTick method.</li>
  <pre>
    public void updateTick(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, Random rand)
    {
  </pre>
  <li>Inside we will be checking to make sure the block below our tunnel block meets a certain condition.</li>
  <li>In this project we will be checking if the material of the block below is rock. This includes stone, cobblestone ores and most of the blocks under the ground/dirt.</li>
  <li>pos.add(x,y,z) is a way to grab a block relative to the position. We can also use pos.down()</li>
  <li>getBlockState will grab the block at a certain position in the world.</li>
  <pre>
    if(worldIn.getBlockState(pos.add(0,-1,0)).getMaterial() == Material.ROCK) {

    }
  </pre>
  <li>Now that we know the block below is a rock we will destroy the block underneath. (true parameter means the destroyed block will drop an item.)</li>
  <pre>worldIn.destroyBlock(pos.add(0,-1,0), true);</pre>
  <li>Then we will set the block we just destroyed to the current block state of our tunnel block</li>
  <pre>worldIn.setBlockState(pos.add(0,-1,0), state);</pre>
  <li>The next line of code we will set the original location to air.</li>
  <pre>worldIn.setBlockToAir(pos);</pre>
  <li>Finally we will schedule a new update for the block we just move into and repeat the steps above after 10 ticks.</li>
  <pre>worldIn.scheduleUpdate(pos.add(0,-1,0), state.getBlock(), 10); </pre>
</ol>

<h2>Full Code</h2>
<pre>

  public boolean onBlockActivated(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, EntityPlayer playerIn, EnumHand hand, EnumFacing facing, float hitX, float hitY, float hitZ)
  {
    worldIn.scheduleUpdate(pos, state.getBlock(), 10);
      return true;
  }

  public void updateTick(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, Random rand)
  {
      if(worldIn.getBlockState(pos.add(0,-1,0)).getMaterial() == Material.ROCK) {
        worldIn.destroyBlock(pos.add(0,-1,0), true);
        worldIn.setBlockState(pos.add(0,-1,0), state);
        worldIn.setBlockToAir(pos);
        worldIn.scheduleUpdate(pos.add(0,-1,0), state.getBlock(), 10);
      }
  }
</pre>


<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has
    been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
  <li>You can switch to survival mode by typing "/gamemode s" while in the game.</li>
  <li>Try placing and right clicking the block to make it move through the ground.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intermediate: Change the movment of the block</h2>
<p>Try to make the block move sideways, up or diagonally by adjusting the pos.add() method. </p>

<h2>Advanced: Create Block Recipe</h2>
<p>Try to create a recipe inside of the recipes.json file inside of resources. You can try using the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_recipe.html">Create Recipe guide.</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to src/main/resources/assets.dm.recipes.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste either a shaped or shapeless recipe.</li>
  <li>Adjust the name of the file and it's contents to match your recipe idea.</li>

</ol>
