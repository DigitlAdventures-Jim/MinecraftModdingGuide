<h1>Replace Armor Texture</h1>
<p>This is a guide that will help students replace DigiMod armor textures with their own designs
which is the quickest way to have their armor ready in minecraft.</p>


<h2>Replace Armor Texture Files</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Name the file to correctly match the name of the files to digi_layer_1 and digi_layer_2.</li>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/textures/models/armor.</li>
  <li>Drag your item texture into the items folder either on top of any of the files in the folder, or
    on the actual folder.
  </li>
  <li>It will prompt you to copy or link the file into the folder, you will almost always want to copy.</li>
  <li>It will ask you to overwrite the old images, we will want to do this as well.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create Armor Icons</h2>
<p>Although the armor when worn will look like the armor you designed, the icons will not because they are not associated with the
images we just created. Armor when not worn act like items .You will need to create a 16x16 icon for the digi_helmet.png, digi_chestplate.png, digi_leggings.png and digi_boots.png</p>
that closely resemble your armor designs. You can use the link below for help with replacing armor icon/item textures<p>
