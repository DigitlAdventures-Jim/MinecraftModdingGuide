<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Activity</h2>


<h2>Find DigiEvents</h2>
<ol>

<li>Navigate to src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/DigiEvents.java</li>

<li>Start by subscribing a new event within this class file. When we subscribe to an event it
  allows this code to listen for and trigger once the event associated with it occurs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create Super Sprinting Event</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Next create our new listening event called SuperSprinting, which will be passing through the PlayerTickEvent
  that we can give an instance/temporary name of 'event'</li>
  <li>event will now hold information about the player every tick of the game.</li>
  <pre>
    @SubscribeEvent
    public void SuperSprinting(PlayerTickEvent event){
    }
  </pre>
<li>Next we want to check if the player is sprinting</li>
<li>If the player is sprinting then we will set the players walkspeed to 1F, which is about 1block per tick.</li>
<li>If we are not sprinting we will se the speed back to 0.1F which is about the normal speed of a player in minecraft.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Completed Code</h2>
<pre>
  @SubscribeEvent
	public void SuperSprinting(PlayerTickEvent event){
		if(event.player.isSprinting()) {
			event.player.capabilities.setPlayerWalkSpeed(1f);
		}else {
			event.player.capabilities.setPlayerWalkSpeed(0.1f);
		}
	}
</pre>

<h2>Intermediate</h2>
<p>Change some other player capabilities.</p>
