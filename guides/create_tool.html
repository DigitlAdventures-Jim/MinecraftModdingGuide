<h1>Create Tool</h1>
<p>Tools include Swords, Hoes, Pickaxes, Axes and Spades(shovels).</p>
<p>Tools are very similar to items except that they are treated differently when holding them. The difference when adding
a new Tool in compared to an Item is that the Model json file is a bit different and that the initialization of the item
requires a different base class</p>

<h2>Tool Textures</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/textures/items.</li>
  <li>Drag your tool texture into the items folder either on top of any of the files in the folder, or
    on the actual folder.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tool Model</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/models/items.</li>
  <li>to make adding a model file more quickly select the digi_sword.json file, press cmd+c and then cmd+v to copy and paste it.</li>
  <li>The digi_sword.json file is a model file for tools, there are many other similar json model files that can be copied as well.</li>
  <li>Rename the file to match your new item, only use lowercase letters and underscores instead of
  spaces. This guide uses my_tool but you should use your own unique item name</li>
  <li>double click into this new my_tool.json file and change the texture location to match your new item.</li>

  <pre>{
     "parent": "item/handheld",         
     "textures": {                       
         "layer0": "dm:items/my_tool"   
     } 
  } 
  </pre>

</ol>

<h2>Tool Lang</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to MDKExample/src/main/resources/assets.dm/lang/en_us.lang</li>
  <li>Add in a new line of code at the bottom</li>
  <li>type "Item.my_tool.name= My New Tool"</li>
  <li>Everything after the = sign in this line of code will show up as the name of this item in minecraft</li>
  <li>This is only the display name, we will still use my_item as name we refer to the item as in our code</li>
  <pre>
  item.my_tool.name=My New Tool
  </pre>
</ol>

<h2>Initialize</h2>
<p>Navigate to /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/init/DigiItems.java</p>

<h3>Creating a tool Material</h3>
<p>A tool material gives a tool stats and is normally used for sets of tools but can be used for individual tools as well.</p>
<p>You don't need to create a new tool Material for every tool, you can use previouse ones.</p>
<p>Under the MATERIAL_DIGI code you can create a very similar line of code but replace the names and arguments.</p>
<pre>
  public static final ToolMaterial MATERIAL_NEW = EnumHelper.addToolMaterial("material_new", 3, 500, 20.0F, 3.0F, 10);
</pre>
<p>addToolMatieral takes 6 arguments; resource name, harvest level,durability, speed, damage and enchantability</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resource Name: (String) Name of the material.</li>
  <li>Harvest Level:(Integer) Ability for the tool to recieve the item from a certain level ore. 0 is the lowest, 3 is the highest</li>
  <li>Durability: (Integer) The amount of times the tool can be used before it breaks.</li>
  <li>Speed: (Float) How quickly the tool breaks blocks it is designed for.</li>
  <li>Damage: (Float)Base damage for items, swords will do a bonus 3-4 damage.</li>
  <li>Enchantability: (Integer) Likelihood that when the item is enchanted, it will recieve better effects. 0 is low and 500 is very high.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Initialize Tool</h3>
<p>By looking at how the other Digi Tools are created you can use the same pattern to initialize your own tools.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scroll to the bottom where it says "//New Items"</li>
  <li>Add this new line of Java Code "public static final ItemSword MY_TOOL = new ToolSword("my_tool");"</li>
  <li>You can use replace Sword with Pickaxe, Hoe, Axe or Spade.</li>
  <li>These tools require 2 arguments, The tool material that we created earlier and the resource name for the tools</li>
  <li>In this code we are creating a new ItemSword called MY_TOOL which is a clone of the ToolSword()</li>
<pre>public static final ItemSword MY_TOOL = new ToolSword("my_tool", MATERIAL_NEW);</pre>
  <li>ToolSword() holds all of the information for adding this item into minecraft and connecting
  the texture and model files to this item. It also gives the item sword specific code like hitting mobs.</li>
  <li>The other Tool base classes apply the basic tool abilities they are associated with.</li>
  <li>Public static final are identifiers which describe how this new instance or clone of the new tool can be
  interacted with.</li>
</ol>
