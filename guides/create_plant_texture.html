<h1>Create Plant Texture</h1>

<p>A plant is a complex feature of minecraft as it includes an item and a block. The item is a seed we can plant and the Block is a BlockCrops
that has up to 7 images. </p>

<h2>Go To Piskel App</h2>
<p>
Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.piskelapp.com/create" target="_blank">www.piskelapp.com/create</a>. Piskel app
will allow us to create png images which are needed for minecraft textures. png files have transparent
backgrounds which are necesarry for designing in games so that we don't have big white background boxes
thoughout.
</p>


<h2>Resize Image</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the resize button on the right side of the screen</li>
  <li>Change the size to 16x16 to match minecrafts pixel size</li>
  <li>Click the yellow resize button</li>
</ol>


<h2>Design Plant Block Images</h2>
<p>
  Plants should be designed with from 4-8 drawings. Each plant is capable of 7 steps during it's growth but we can use
  the same design for two steps. Piskel app allows for animation frames on the left side which will allow for use
  to see the changes between each plant for a more smooth plant growth.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure to enable the onion skin on the right, belwo the preview so we can compare our current frame to the previous frame.</li>
  <li>You can create more frames by clicking add a new frame at the top left.</li>
  <li>Hover over the toolbar on the left to read what each tool does.</li>
