<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are going to design a mod today that created a block where when a living
   entity steps on it, it will create a cage around it as well as apply a harmful effect.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>In programming we may want to access a class that is lower in the object tree.
In today's project we will need to downcast from the very top level class of Entity (which includes arrows,
 fireballs and other non-living things) to the more specific class EntityLivingBase. EntityLivingBase is built from the Entity class and includes the living things in
  minecraft that we will be able to add potion effects to.</p>


<h2>Create Block Texture</h2>
<p>Use the create Create Block Texture guide to create a new block texture.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_block_texture.html">Create Block Texture</a>

<h2>Create a block</h2>
<p>Use the Block Creation guide add a new custom block to minecraft.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_block.html">Create Block</a>

<h2>Rename the Block</h2>
<p>Use the Naming Items and Blocks guide to change the name of the digi_block within the en_us.lang file.</p>
<p>Feel free to use special color codes for more unique names here.</p>

<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create TrapBlock Class</h2>
<p>Within the /MDKExample/src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/init/DigiBlocks.java file
we will want to change the class of our custom block from BlockBase to TrapBlock</p>
<pre>public static final BlockBase TRAP_BLOCK = new TrapBlock("trap_block"); </pre>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the lightbulb on the left of this line of code to create a new class called TrapBlock.</li>
  <li>In the package name you will want to type in "com.digitaladventures.digimod.blocks".</li>
  <li>This should open a new class, we will want to make sure this Block extends BlockBase.</li>
  <li>BlockBase sets up the block so it is registered into our mod.</li>
  <li>Hover over the error on the left and add in the required constructor.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Create onEntityWalk Method </h2>
<p>Type in the code below to setup a method that will
  activate when entities jump onto the trap block.</p>

<pre>
  public void onEntityWalk(World worldIn, BlockPos pos, Entity entityIn)
        {

        }
</pre>

<p>
  Next, inside this method, we will create code which will check if the entity is living.
To see if an object is an instance of another class we can use <pre>instanceof</pre> operator.
</p>
<pre>
  if (entityIn instanceof EntityLivingBase) {

        }
</pre>

<p>Now that we avoided creating traps for arrows and other inanimate entities (which would cause errors)
we can add a harmful effect. We will first downcast the entity to an EntityLivingBase and then apply a harmful effect.</p>

<pre>
  EntityLivingBase enemy = ((EntityLivingBase)entityIn);
	enemy.addPotionEffect(new PotionEffect(MobEffects.POISON));
</pre>

<p>Next let's create the container for the enemy to trap them. We will do this by creating blocks to surround the entity.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First we will make sure the enemy sticks to the midle of the cage at first
     as they may escape the trap with their momentum.
     <pre>
       entityIn.setPosition(pos.getX()+0.5f, pos.getY()+1f, pos.getZ()+0.5f);
     </pre>
  </li>

    <li>Next choose a blockstate to place. Blockstates contain a block and a state, which is how the block
    will look when it is placed. We almost always use a defualt state but some blocks like doors, steps,or levers have
    alternate states which can be used.
    <pre>IBlockState wall = Blocks.GLASS.getDefaultState();</pre>
  </li>

  <li>Building the cage around the enemy will require use to use the variable pos which is the position of the block</li>
  <li>.north(), .up() and other functions added at the end of the pos will grab block positions in those directions.</li>
  <li>Let's start by replacing the oroginal block and creating blocks in all 4 directions around the trap and up one block.</li>

  <pre>
    worldIn.setBlockState(pos, wall);
    worldIn.setBlockState(pos.north().up(), wall);
    worldIn.setBlockState(pos.south().up(), wall);
    worldIn.setBlockState(pos.east().up(), wall);
    worldIn.setBlockState(pos.west().up(), wall);
  </pre>

  <li>Then let's add a number in the up() method to create walls a bit higher upwards so
    enemies can't jump over them. We can also add a top to the cage.</li>

    <pre>
      worldIn.setBlockState(pos.north().up(2), wall);
      worldIn.setBlockState(pos.south().up(2), wall);
      worldIn.setBlockState(pos.east().up(2), wall);
      worldIn.setBlockState(pos.west().up(2), wall);
      worldIn.setBlockState(pos.up(3), wall);
    </pre>

</ol>


<h2>Test your Block</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Press the run button at the top left to test your block to see if it has
    been added to the minecraft mod.</li>
  <li>Students should create or join a single player, creative mode world.</li>
  <li>You can switch to survival mode by typing "/gamemode s" while in the game.</li>
  <li>Try breaking it in survival with a pickaxe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intermediate: Extend Trap container</h2>
<p>Try to create a trap that has a large interior for larger amounts of enemies to trap.</p>

<h2>Advanced: Create Block Recipe</h2>
<p>Try to create a recipe inside of the recipes.json file inside of resources. You can try using the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_recipe.html">Create Recipe guide.</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to src/main/resources/assets.dm.recipes.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste either a shaped or shapeless recipe.</li>
  <li>Adjust the name of the file and it's contents to match your recipe idea.</li>

</ol>
