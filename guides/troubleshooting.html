<h1>TroubleShooting</h1>


<h2>Editor Found Errors</h2>
<p>Errors in Java can be found many times with the red underlines, or red x bubbles on the left
and red lightbulbs</p>
<p>Red lightbulbs indicate that eclipse has a suggestion, this can many times fix type mismatches,
typo's or suggest libraries to import.</p>
<p>CMD+shift+o is the fastest way to import libraries. As a rule of thumb the libraries
   we choose (when there are more than one option) are the ones associated with net.minecraft</p>


<h2>Reading Console Errors</h2>
<p>The console log is a great way to find errors as well. In some cases we may try
to run code that will break minecraft while it is running or loading.</p>
<p>When an error does occur, Java will tell us the stacktrace at the time of the error,
this is usually very long, but in almost all cases we can find a few files that are DigiMod files
associated with the error.</p>

<h2>Print to the Console</h2>
<p>We can use <pre>System.out.print("Display text here")</pre> to display text to see if minecraft has
passed certain conditions, or we can print out objects, variables or anything else which may be helpful
in spotting an error.</p>


<h2>Researching online</h2>
<p>Many people use minecraft forge to create mods and there are many helpful resources you can review.</p>
<p>Although 1.12.2 has some differences with earlier versions, many of the functions still work the same, so trying older
  techniques is viable.</p>

<h2>Issues with Textures</h2>
<p>This is almost always caused by a mispelled or misplaced filename.</p>
<p>You can also make sure the .json files are correctly written.</p>
<p>Occasionally you will see this happen with incorrect registration within the init Java files.</p>

<h2>Nothing is happening when I use my item when there should be something happening.</h2>
<p>If an Item or Block has an event that is supposed to trigger function but it does not, it
is many times a typo or error in the Event Handler. A mispelling in the Event will not cause an error
in minecraft and it will simply be ignored when many other errors will cause a crash, or cause minecraft
to fail when loading.</p>

<h2>Reading Minecraft Code</h2>
<p>When researching ways to program your items you can also peek into the code for minecraft. You can do this
by highlighting a class name, right clicking and selecting open declaration, open call heirarchy, open type hierarchy</p>

<h2>'Launching Client' has encountered a problem</h2>
<p>Variable references empty selection: ${project_loc}</p>
<p>This means we tried to test our project while we had a non-mod class/file selected. Simply select any digimod folder and press 'Run' again.</p>


<h2>Every minecraft import not found</h2>
<p>This likley means the forgeSrc library is pointing to the wront place.
  You can configure the build path and choose a different version rebuild the project</p>
