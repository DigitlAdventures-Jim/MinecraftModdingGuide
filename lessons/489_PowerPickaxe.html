<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today we will be creating a pickaxe which is extra powerful having the ability
to break through many blocks at once using for loops.</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>The activity today should show student in slow motion how nested for loops work.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Draw a 4x4 grid on the board.</li>
  <li>If we want a computer to draw a cicle in each of these squares we could
  tell it to draw a circle 16 times. This means we would have to give it 16 instructions.</li>
  <li>This might be doable here, but what if we wanted 1,000,000 circles? That would be impossible for us!</li>
  <li>We can use loops instead to speed up this process.</li>
  <li>We can tell the computer to repeat the action of drawing a circle across 4 times.</li>
  <li>Then we can tell the computer to repeat that whole action 4 more times going downward.</li>
  <li>4 times 4 is 16!</li>
</ol>

<p>Use the <a target="_blank" href="../guides/create_item.html">Create Item Guide</a> to create a new Pickaxe in minecraft</p>

<h2>Create Custom Class</h2>
  <p>After we create the Initialize code we will want to change the class of the Pickaxe.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your Initialize code should read...</li>
    <pre>public static final ItemPickaxe POWER_PICKAXE = new PowerPickaxe("power_pickaxe", MATERIAL_DIGI);</pre>
    <li>Click the error lightbulb on the left of this line of code to create a new class automatically. </li>
    <li>In the popup window you will want to change the package name to com.digitaladventures.digimod.item then press finish.</li>
    <li>This should open up a new file.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Edit Custom Class</h2>
  <p>We will now make sure this class works like a pickaxe but with an added ability.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>First, extend the ToolPickaxe class instead of ItemPickaxe. ToolPickaxe holds a lot of basic code needed to setup the pickaxe in our mod.</li>
    <li>You should see an error on the left side, you want to click on that and select "add constructor".</li>
    <li>Next we will add add a method that will be activated when a player breaks a block. You can copy and paste
    this from the src/main/java/com/digitaladventures/digimod/items/base/ItemBase.java file.</li>
    <li>To break an extra block we can use the script below which destroys a block at the position of the block that was broken (not that helpful but we will adjust this soon).
    The "true" argument is to make sure drops occur on these bonus destroyed block.</li>
    <pre>worldIn.destroyBlock(pos, true);</pre>
  </ol>

<h2>Creating a for Loop</h2>
  <p>We now want to wrap 3 for loops around this block breaking script.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First adjust the pos value of the destroyBlock method to pos.add(x,y,z). add(x,y,z) will translate the block position by a certain amount.</li>
    <li>This will allow us to plug numbers from our for loops into this to break other blocks around the original broken block. </li>
    <li>We want to create a loop which will make the broken block the center. This means each loop must start at a -3 and end at 3.</li>
    <li>Start with the x loop. <pre>for (int x=-3; x<3; x++){}</pre> with the block breaking script in between.</li>
    <li>Then wrap a y loop written nearly the same way but with a y variable.</li>
    <li>Then wrap a z loop written nearly the same way but with a z variable.</li>
    <li>Return false at the end of the onBlockDestroyed method. I believe this controls wether or not the item durability is reduced.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p>Test your mod, make sure to use survival mode as the onBlockDestroyed() method will not
activate in creative mode.</p>

<h2>Finished Code</h2>
  <pre>
    public class PowerPickaxe extends ToolPickaxe {

    	public PowerPickaxe(String name, ToolMaterial material) {
    		super(name, material);
    		// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    	}

        public boolean onBlockDestroyed(ItemStack stack, World worldIn, IBlockState state, BlockPos pos, EntityLivingBase p)
        {
        	for (int x=-3; x<3; x++) {
        		for (int y=-3; y<3;y++) {
        			for (int z=-3; z<3;z++) {
        			worldIn.destroyBlock(pos.add(x, y, z), true);
        			}
        		}
        	}
            return false;
        }

    }
  </pre>
